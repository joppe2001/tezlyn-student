# this will be a simple project on grid

***
so i want you to create a grid container using the following css styles.

## display: grid

## grid-template-columns & grid-template-rows

## grid-areas

## grid-gap/ gap

## remember to use flex and other important styling to your body to make sure main-container is centered in the screen

### goodluck ( you can always look things up online, just do not use any form of A.I. )
